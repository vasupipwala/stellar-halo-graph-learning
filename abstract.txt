Title:- Physics-Driven Stellar Stream Ensembles and Graph-Based Representation Learning


Stellar streams produced by the tidal disruption of globular clusters are among the most sensitive tracers of the Galactic gravitational potential. However, the interpretation of stellar streams is complicated by degeneracies between progenitor-specific physics (such as mass, internal evolution, and stripping history) and halo-driven dynamics, which can imprint overlapping signatures on stream morphology and phase-space structure (e.g. Fardal et al. 2015; Sanders & Binney 2013; Bonaca et al. 2019; Vasiliev & Baumgardt 2021; Pearson et al. 2022). In this project, we construct a deliberately controlled ensemble of stellar streams and use graph neural networks (GNNs) as representation-learning tools to investigate whether halo geometry emerges as a natural organizing principle of stream phase-space structure, independent of progenitor variation.

Streams are generated using particle-spray methods based on the formalism of Fardal et al. (2015), within a Hamiltonian framework that explicitly separates orbital dynamics from tidal stripping. The Galactic potential is modeled as a smooth, time-independent halo with spherical, oblate, and prolate symmetries. This idealized choice is intentional: it allows clean isolation of geometric effects known to induce stream–orbit misalignment (e.g. Pearson et al. 2015, 2017) without contamination from baryonic components, time dependence, or substructure. Progenitor physics is included only at the lowest order through finite progenitor mass, which controls tidal stripping while suppressing higher-order internal cluster dynamics.

Each stream is represented as a graph in six-dimensional phase space, and a GNN is trained to learn stream-level embeddings. Crucially, the network is not trained to infer halo parameters or to model the Milky Way directly. Instead, it is used as a diagnostic instrument to test a representation hypothesis: whether streams generated in the same halo geometry but with different progenitor masses naturally cluster in embedding space, while streams with similar progenitors but different halo geometries separate. This hypothesis is non-trivial and falsifiable, as machine-learning models often preferentially encode local or progenitor-driven features rather than global dynamical structure.

By framing machine learning as a tool for controlled dynamical experimentation rather than prediction, this project establishes a principled pathway for identifying invariant-like features of stellar streams. The resulting framework is designed to fail informatively and to serve as a foundation for future extensions incorporating more realistic Galactic potentials and observational data.
