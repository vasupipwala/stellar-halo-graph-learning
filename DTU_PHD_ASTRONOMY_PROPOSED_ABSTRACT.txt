Title
Learning Dynamical Invariants of Globular-Cluster Stellar Streams with Equivariant Graph Neural Networks

Abstract
Stellar streams formed by the tidal disruption of globular clusters are sensitive tracers of the Milky Way’s gravitational potential and therefore of its dark matter halo structure. However, the interpretation of these systems is limited by strong degeneracies between the influence of the Galactic potential and the internal properties of the progenitor cluster. Many commonly used stream observables depend on both effects, reducing their robustness as probes of dark matter.

This PhD project aims to identify dynamical invariants of stellar streams—features that are insensitive to progenitor physics but respond predictably to the geometry and radial structure of the Galactic dark matter halo. Building on recent work demonstrating stream–orbit misalignment and orbital-plane precession as signatures of non-spherical potentials, the project will use equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn physically meaningful representations of stellar streams directly from phase-space data.

Stellar streams will be modeled as unordered sets of stars in six-dimensional phase space and represented as graphs whose nodes correspond to stars and whose edges encode local geometric and kinematic relationships. Equivariant GNNs, constructed to respect the rotational and translational symmetries of gravitational dynamics, will be trained on ensembles of globular-cluster disruption simulations spanning a wide range of progenitor properties and halo configurations. The networks will learn low-dimensional latent representations that minimize sensitivity to progenitor variations while maximizing sensitivity to halo shape and radial mass distribution.

These learned invariants will then be applied to observed Galactic stellar streams to place robust constraints on the Milky Way’s dark matter halo. By shifting the focus from fitting individual streams to discovering symmetry-aware, physically robust stream diagnostics, this project will provide a new methodological foundation for stellar-stream-based Galactic dynamics and enable more reliable inference from current and future astrometric surveys.
