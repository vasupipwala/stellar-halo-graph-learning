	abstract = {This paper presents an example where the morphology of a single stellar stream can be used to rule out a specific galactic potential form without the need for velocity information. We investigate the globular cluster Palomar 5 (Pal 5), which is tidally disrupting into a cold, thin stream mapped over 22 deg on the sky with a typical width of 0.7 deg. We generate models of this stream by fixing Pal 5's present-day position, distance, and radial velocity via observations, while allowing its proper motion to vary. In a spherical dark matter halo we easily find models that fit the observed morphology. However, no plausible Pal 5 model could be found in the triaxial potential of Law \& Majewski, which has been proposed to explain the properties of the Sagittarius stream. In this case, the long, thin, and curved morphology of the Pal 5 stream alone can be used to rule out such a potential configuration. Pal 5-like streams in this potential are either too straight, missing the curvature of the observations, or show an unusual morphology which we dub stream-fanning: a signature sensitive to the triaxiality of a potential. We conclude that the mere existence of other thin tidal streams must provide broad constraints on the orientation and shape of the dark matter halo they inhabit.},

	abstract = {The stellar stream emerging from the globular cluster Palomar 5 (Pal 5) is one of the few Galactic streams that is clearly associated with its progenitor system. Recent optical photometric data show that Pal 5’s leading arm appears truncated compared with the trailing arm, which is not expected from previous simulations. We demonstrate that inclusion of the rotating Galactic bar in the dynamical modelling of Pal 5 can reproduce the truncation. As the bar sweeps by, stream stars experience differences in net torques near their orbital pericentres. This leads to the formation of discontinuities in the energy distribution of stream members that in turn become apparent as ever-widening gaps in the stream’s spatial density. We conclude that only streams orbiting far from the Galactic Centre or streams on retrograde orbits can be used to unambiguously constrain dark matter subhalo interactions. Additionally, we expect that the Pal 5 leading-arm debris should reappear south of the density truncation.},

However, this approach has limitations due to the complex dynamical interactions between these structures and their environment. Perturbations such as tidal forces exerted by the Milky Way, the potential escape of stars, and passages through the Galactic plane can result in the loss of dynamical coherence of stars in these structures. Consequently, relying solely on dynamics may be insufficient for detecting such disrupted or dispersed remnants.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We combine chemistry and dynamics, integrated through a system of neural networks, to develop a clustering method for identifying accreted structures in the Galactic halo.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We developed an integrated approach combining Siamese neural networks (SNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), autoencoders, and the OPTICS algorithm to create a comprehensive procedure named CREEK. This method is designed to uncover stellar structures in the Galactic halo. Initially, CREEK was trained on known globular clusters (GCs) and then applied to the dataset to identify stellar streams.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} CREEK successfully recovered 80\% of the GCs present in the APOGEE dataset, re-identified several known stellar streams, and identified a potential new stream. Additionally, within highly populated stellar structures, CREEK can identify substructures that exhibit distinct chemical compositions and orbital energies. This approach provides an objective data-driven method for selecting stars associated with streams and stellar structures in general.},

In this paper, we propose a new neural network model, called graph neural network (GNN) model, that extends existing neural network methods for processing the data represented in graph domains. This GNN model, which can directly process most of the practically useful types of graphs, e.g., acyclic, cyclic, directed, and undirected, implements a function tau(G,n) isin IRm that maps a graph G and one of its nodes n into an m-dimensional Euclidean space. A supervised learning algorithm is derived to estimate the parameters of the proposed GNN model. The computational cost of the proposed algorithm is also considered. Some experimental results are shown to validate the proposed learning algorithm, and to demonstrate its generalization capabilities.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI. The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between "hand-engineering" and "end-to-end" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.},

Group convolution layers are easy to use and can be implemented with negligible computational overhead for discrete groups generated by translations, reflections and rotations.

In contrast with existing methods, our work does not require computationally expensive higher-order representations in intermediate layers while it still achieves competitive or better performance. In addition, whereas existing methods are limited to equivariance on 3 dimensional spaces, our model is easily scaled to higher-dimensional spaces.

	abstract = {We study numerical simulations of satellite galaxy disruption in a potential resembling that of the Milky Way. Our goal is to assess whether a merger origin for the stellar halo would leave observable fossil structure in the phase-space distribution of nearby stars. We show how mixing of disrupted satellites can be quantified using a coarse-grained entropy. Although after 10 Gyr few obvious asymmetries remain in the distribution of particles in configuration space, strong correlations are still present in velocity space. We give a simple analytic description of these effects, based on a linearized treatment in action-angle variables, which shows how the kinematic and density structure of the debris stream changes with time. By applying this description we find that a single dwarf elliptical-like satellite of current luminosity 108 L⊙ disrupted 10 Gyr ago from an orbit circulating in the inner halo (mean apocentre ∼12 kpc) would contribute about ∼30 kinematically cold streams with internal velocity dispersions below 5 km s−1 to the local stellar halo. If the whole stellar halo were built by such disrupted satellites, it should consist locally of 300–500 such streams. Clear detection of all these structures would require a sample of a few thousand stars with 3D velocities accurate to better than 5 km s−1. Even with velocity errors several times worse than this, the expected clumpiness should be quite evident. We apply our formalism to a group of stars detected near the North Galactic Pole, and derive an order-of-magnitude estimate for the initial properties of the progenitor system.},
